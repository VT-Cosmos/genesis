The GovNo and AtomOne Validators directory is a space to build a registry of GovNo and AtomOne validators for the community. A comprehensive list of validators, with information on who they are and how to get in touch, will make it easier for the community to engage directly with one another, coordinate upcoming tasks, and collaborate more efficiently. This directory is also a great space to discuss validator-related proposals in regard to operating requirements, upcoming tasks, implementation ideas, or proposed solutions.

We are inviting all validators who have voted NO or NWV on CosmosHub proposal #848 to submit their request for participation through a pull request. 

The Validators directory of the AtomOne repo is an initiative to help serve as a guide to:
* make it easier for existing projects and newcomers to identify the approved validators
* find development synergies and implementations
* make introductions to potential partners
* get plugged into the ecosystem
